## [0.34.2] - 2026-01-04

## [0.34.1] - 2026-01-04

### Added

## [0.34.0] - 2026-01-04

### Added

- `Editor.getExpandedText()` method that returns text with paste markers expanded to their actual content ([#444](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/444) by [@aliou](https://github.com/aliou))

## [0.33.0] - 2026-01-04

### Breaking Changes

- **Key detection functions removed**: All `isXxx()` key detection functions (`isEnter()`, `isEscape()`, `isCtrlC()`, etc.) have been removed. Use `matchesKey(data, keyId)` instead (e.g., `matchesKey(data, "enter")`, `matchesKey(data, "ctrl+c")`). This affects hooks and custom tools that use `ctx.ui.custom()` with keyboard input handling. ([#405](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/405))

### Added

- `Editor.insertTextAtCursor(text)` method for programmatic text insertion ([#419](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/419))
- `EditorKeybindingsManager` for configurable editor keybindings. Components now use `matchesKey()` and keybindings manager instead of individual `isXxx()` functions. ([#405](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/405) by [@hjanuschka](https://github.com/hjanuschka))

### Changed

- Key detection refactored: consolidated `is*()` functions into generic `matchesKey(data, keyId)` function that accepts key identifiers like `"ctrl+c"`, `"shift+enter"`, `"alt+left"`, etc.

## [0.32.3] - 2026-01-03

## [0.32.2] - 2026-01-03

### Fixed

- Slash command autocomplete now triggers for commands starting with `.`, `-`, or `_` (e.g., `/.land`, `/-foo`) ([#422](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/422))

## [0.32.1] - 2026-01-03

## [0.32.0] - 2026-01-03

### Changed

- Editor component now uses word wrapping instead of character-level wrapping for better readability ([#382](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/382) by [@nickseelert](https://github.com/nickseelert))

### Fixed

- Shift+Space, Shift+Backspace, and Shift+Delete now work correctly in Kitty-protocol terminals (Kitty, WezTerm, etc.) instead of being silently ignored ([#411](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/411) by [@nathyong](https://github.com/nathyong))

## [0.31.1] - 2026-01-02

### Fixed

- `visibleWidth()` now strips OSC 8 hyperlink sequences, fixing text wrapping for clickable links ([#396](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/396) by [@Cursivez](https://github.com/Cursivez))

## [0.31.0] - 2026-01-02

### Added

- `isShiftCtrlO()` key detection function for Shift+Ctrl+O (Kitty protocol)
- `isShiftCtrlD()` key detection function for Shift+Ctrl+D (Kitty protocol)
- `TUI.onDebug` callback for global debug key handling (Shift+Ctrl+D)
- `wrapTextWithAnsi()` utility now exported (wraps text to width, preserving ANSI codes)

### Changed

- README.md completely rewritten with accurate component documentation, theme interfaces, and examples
- `visibleWidth()` reimplemented with grapheme-based width calculation, 10x faster on Bun and ~15% faster on Node ([#369](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/369) by [@nathyong](https://github.com/nathyong))

### Fixed

- Markdown component now renders HTML tags as plain text instead of silently dropping them ([#359](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/359))
- Crash in `visibleWidth()` and grapheme iteration when encountering undefined code points ([#372](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/372) by [@HACKE-RC](https://github.com/HACKE-RC))
- ZWJ emoji sequences (rainbow flag, family, etc.) now render with correct width instead of being split into multiple characters ([#369](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/369) by [@nathyong](https://github.com/nathyong))

## [0.29.0] - 2025-12-25

### Added

- **Auto-space before pasted file paths**: When pasting a file path (starting with `/`, `~`, or `.`) and the cursor is after a word character, a space is automatically prepended for better readability. Useful when dragging screenshots from macOS. ([#307](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/307) by [@mitsuhiko](https://github.com/mitsuhiko))
- **Word navigation for Input component**: Added Ctrl+Left/Right and Alt+Left/Right support for word-by-word cursor movement. ([#306](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/306) by [@kim0](https://github.com/kim0))
- **Full Unicode input**: Input component now accepts Unicode characters beyond ASCII. ([#306](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/306) by [@kim0](https://github.com/kim0))

### Fixed

- **Readline-style Ctrl+W**: Now skips trailing whitespace before deleting the preceding word, matching standard readline behavior. ([#306](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/306) by [@kim0](https://github.com/kim0))
